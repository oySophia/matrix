This work repository is specially designed for the mpi caculating of large matrixes multiplication,

and i will complete such work step by step as follows:

1. get the matrix;

2. finish the basic muliplications;

3. further improve the algorithm of the matrix-multiplication

4. What I've taken into consideration of the performance factors are listed below:
	
	the core's number

	the parallel degree you have your codes to run on

	the environment is balancing or not

	matrix-self's contents or numbers

	algorithm's impact

	finally, we can simplify the hardware caculation.(by2 etc.)
